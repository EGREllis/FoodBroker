# FoodBroker
Enable people to donate food to restaurants to cook to feed those in need in the Covid-19 outbreak.
The idea changed to focus on brokering exchange of medical supplies in the users location.

This project was made for the Covid-19 DevPost hackathon.  It was my first hackathon.

The essential idea was to broker free exchange of supplies in the crisis.
Users could register surplus/demand for medical supplies and find a partner to exchange with based on location and their willingness to travel.
